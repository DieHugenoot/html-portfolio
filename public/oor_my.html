<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>"It is certain that we'll return to the dust from whence we came, but ideas of impact, once published and preserved, will forever remain." - GabriÃ«l van der Berg
<p></p>

<p>Ideas are often only as powerful as the zeal and creativity with which they are presented. The projects I have created gives you an indication of my skill-set and overall ability to help visualise your ideas to the world or to sell your products to your customers. </p>
